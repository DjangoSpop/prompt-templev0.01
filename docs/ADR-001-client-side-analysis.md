# ADR-001: Client-Side Chat Analysis Approach

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The PromptTemple system needs to provide users with the ability to analyze their chat exports (from ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) to discover patterns in their prompting behavior and identify the most effective prompts. 

We had two main options for implementing this functionality:
1. Server-side processing: Upload files to Django backend for analysis
2. Client-side processing: Parse and analyze files directly in the browser

## Decision
We will implement chat analysis entirely on the client-side using JavaScript/TypeScript in the browser.

## Rationale

### Privacy & Security
- **User data stays local**: Chat exports never leave the user's device, addressing privacy concerns
- **No server storage**: Eliminates need for secure file storage and data retention policies
- **GDPR compliance**: Easier compliance since no personal data is processed server-side
- **User trust**: Users feel more comfortable analyzing sensitive conversations locally

### Performance & Scalability
- **Reduced server load**: No computational burden on Django backend
- **Instant processing**: No upload time or server queue delays
- **Scalable**: Client resources scale with user count automatically
- **Offline capable**: Analysis can work without internet connection

### Technical Benefits
- **Simpler architecture**: No need for file upload, storage, and cleanup systems
- **Faster iteration**: No backend changes needed for analysis improvements
- **Rich interactivity**: Real-time updates as users explore their data
- **Browser capabilities**: Modern browsers are powerful enough for this analysis

### Implementation Approach
```typescript
// Client-side analysis flow
const analyzePrompts = (messages: ChatMessage[]): AnalysisResults => {
  // 1. Extract user prompts from chat data
  const prompts = messages.filter(msg => msg.role === 'user');
  
  // 2. Frequency analysis
  const promptCounts = countPromptFrequency(prompts);
  
  // 3. Simple clustering by keywords
  const clusters = performKeywordClustering(prompts);
  
  // 4. Generate insights and recommendations
  const insights = generateInsights(prompts, clusters);
  
  return { topPrompts, clusters, insights };
};
```

## Consequences

### Positive
- ✅ Enhanced user privacy and trust
- ✅ Reduced backend complexity and costs
- ✅ Faster, more responsive user experience
- ✅ Easier to add new analysis features
- ✅ Works offline after initial page load

### Negative
- ❌ Limited to browser computational capabilities
- ❌ Analysis sophistication constrained by client-side algorithms
- ❌ No cross-user insights or aggregated analytics
- ❌ Dependent on user's device performance

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Progressive enhancement**: Start with simple analysis, add sophistication over time
- **Web Workers**: Use for heavy computation to avoid blocking UI
- **Graceful degradation**: Handle large files by sampling or chunking
- **Clear expectations**: Communicate analysis limitations to users

## Alternatives Considered

### Server-Side Processing
- **Pros**: More sophisticated analysis possible, can leverage AI models, cross-user insights
- **Cons**: Privacy concerns, complex infrastructure, slower user experience, compliance burden

### Hybrid Approach
- **Pros**: Best of both worlds - local privacy with server power for advanced features
- **Cons**: Increased complexity, user confusion about what data goes where

## Implementation Notes

The client-side analysis includes:

1. **File Format Support**: JSON exports from major chat platforms
2. **Core Analysis Features**:
   - Prompt frequency counting
   - Average response length correlation
   - Simple keyword-based clustering
   - Effectiveness scoring (based on response length and reuse patterns)
   - Time-based usage patterns

3. **User Experience**:
   - Drag-and-drop file upload
   - Real-time progress indicators
   - Interactive results visualization
   - Export capability for results

4. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Streaming JSON parsing for large files
   - Debounced analysis updates
   - Memoized computation results
   - Progressive loading of analysis sections

## Future Considerations

- **Advanced Analysis**: Consider WebAssembly for more sophisticated NLP
- **Machine Learning**: Explore TensorFlow.js for local ML models
- **Collaboration**: Optional server-side features with explicit user consent
- **Benchmarking**: Compare local analysis accuracy with server-side alternatives
